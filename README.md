# Titanic_Survivors
Explored and modeled here is the  well known dataset from the April 15, 1912, Titanic incident which resulted in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
Several classifier models were considered to predict the chances of survivor (survived as label) with attributes Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Sex and Embarked.
Survived: Indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
Pclass: Passenger class, which represents the ticket class. It can take values 1 (first class), 2 (second class), or 3 (third class).
Age: The age of the passenger. This column may contain missing values.
SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic with the passenger.
Parch: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic with the passenger.
Fare: The fare or price paid for the ticket.
Sex: The gender of the passenger, either "male" or "female."
Age: The age of the passenger. This column may contain missing values.
Embarked: The port of embarkation, which represents the location where the passenger boarded the Titanic. It can take values "C" (Cherbourg), "Q" (Queenstown), or "S" (Southampton).
The classification algorithms used include: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machanism, Gradient Boosting and K Nearest Neighbours.
